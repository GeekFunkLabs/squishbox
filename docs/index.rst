SquishBox Instructions
======================

The SquishBox is an enclosure for the Raspberry Pi combined with an add-on board that provides a DAC for audio output, a character LCD, a rotary encoder, and a momentary stompswitch. This makes it useful as a portable device for software audio applications like a synthesizer or audio player.

These instructions explain how to put together the SquishBox and install software. The SquishBox can be obtained fully-assembled, in which case skip to the :doc:`installation` section for instructions on installing a Raspberry Pi into the unit. Otherwise, start with :doc:`assembly`. The :doc:`software` section explains how to install for controlling the LCD and buttons, and some default applications. This can be done before or after installing the Raspberry Pi in the SquishBox.
